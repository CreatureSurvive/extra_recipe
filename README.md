# extra_recipe jailbreak

##### Howto:

Clean reboot the device, wait for a couple of minutes, start extra_recipe, wait for 5 seconds or so, then hit "go".
If it says "failed, reboot" you should really reboot.  Re-trying the same app will most likely encounter a kernel panic somewhere down the road.
